# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I am a developer who likes to write software and tinker around with technology.
I enjoy front-ending with Flutter, back-ending with Go and automating with Python.
Steve Jobs is a big inspiration in things I build. One of the things I take forward
with all my work is to treat them like art. Steve treated all the products that Apple bulit
as art that not just looks great but also works great.

> Design isn't just what it looks like and feels like â€” design is how it works.

On the side, I create content on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/ManoVikram),
where I cover a range of topics that interests me!
